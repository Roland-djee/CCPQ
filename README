Decoherence CCPQ project
========================

This code is intended to calculate the decoherence of spin systems
under the influence of a bath of other spins.

Decoherence - Fortran library for spin decoherence
==================================================

Solves for the many-body dynamics of a central spin system coupled to
an interacting spin bath.

- Includes special methods for donor qubits in silicon.
- Includes executable for CPMG dephasing (T2) of donors in silicon
interacting with 29Si nuclear impurities (nuclear spin diffusion).

Installation
============

Requirements:

- Intel or GNU fortran compiler

The following instructions are for a Unix-like environment
without root privileges.

In a terminal,

```sh
mkdir Decoherence
cd Decoherence
git clone http://www.github/UCLGuichard/CCPQ
```

This gets the code. Now let's build it.

```sh
cd src
makefile
```

If all went well, you should now have the three messages

--------Compilation done--------
----Data classification done----
-------Data cleaning done-------

It creates an executable file in the ./bin folder.

***Decoherence has been tested on Linux***

Usage
-----

Run the executable Decoherence.exe in the ./bin folder.
It takes the arguments defined by the files 

System.inp
Dynamics.inp
Output.inp

in the ./input file

2.0 (in progress)

History
=======

Decoherence is based on bits and pieces of old code for certain spin baths
and central spin systems. These were written by R. Guichard starting
in 2014. Methods used to efficiently fill Hamiltonian matrix elements
were originally written in Fortran by Prof. Tania Monteiro.
