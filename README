Decoherence CCPQ project
========================

This code is intended to calculate the decoherence of central 
spin systems entangled with a bath of spin impurities.

Decoherence - Fortran library for spin decoherence
==================================================

Solves for the many-body dynamics of a central spin system coupled to
an interacting spin bath.

- Includes the generation of a crystal structure.
- Includes special methods for decoherence of electron/nuclear qubits.
- Includes sequence of CPMG pulses.

Installation
============

Requirements:

- Intel or GNU fortran compiler

The following instructions are for a Unix-like environment
without root privileges.

In a terminal,

```sh
mkdir Decoherence
cd Decoherence
git clone http://www.github/UCLGuichard/CCPQ
```

This gets the code. Now let's build it.

```sh
cd src
make
```

If all went well, you should now have the three messages

--------Compilation done--------
----Data classification done----
-------Data cleaning done-------

You may wish to modify the makefile to adapt to your own
system.
It creates an executable file in the ./bin folder.

***Decoherence has been tested on Linux***

Usage
-----

Run the executable Decoherence.exe in the ./bin folder.
It takes the arguments defined by the files 

System.inp      ! Sets the properties of the crystal structure
Dynamics.inp    ! Sets the dynamics
Output.inp	! Sets the outputs

in the ./input folder. Modify them for your own purposes.

2.0 (in progress)

History
=======

Decoherence is based on bits and pieces of old code for certain spin baths
and central spin systems. These were written by R. Guichard starting
in 2014. Methods used to efficiently fill Hamiltonian matrix elements
were originally written in Fortran by Prof. Tania Monteiro.
